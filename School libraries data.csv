"Councils were asked to specify the number of schools under their control, the number of these schools with a library, and the number served by both full-time and part-time librarians.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two councils failed to respond to the request. South Lanarkshire council did not provide a specific figure for primary school libraries, instead saying that ""many primary schools have a 'library area'"". ",,,,,,,,,,,,
"In some areas, such as Glasgow and Perth and Kinross, arms length organisations are responsible for library services in some or all secondary schools. In some cases school librarian services are covered by a mixture of 'full-time equivalent' staff.",,,,,,,,,,,,
